# 📦 HiveBox Project – Phase 1: Kickoff and Preparation

## 🧭 1.1 Kickoff

### 🎯 Role and Team Collaboration
In this project, I am working as part of a **DevOps team** responsible for building a complete system to help beekeepers monitor environmental data. I assume collaboration with developers, infrastructure engineers, QA, and monitoring teams. The project simulates a real-world team environment.

### 🧠 Agile Project Management
We follow **Agile** principles for flexible planning and iterative delivery of value.  
Agile is a project management methodology based on continuous improvement, iteration, and team collaboration. Tasks are broken down into smaller, manageable units that are continuously tested and improved.

### ✅ Selected Methodology: **Kanban**
I chose **Kanban** for the following reasons:
- Visual tracking of tasks.
- Easy to adapt to changes.
- Focus on task completion before starting new ones.

### 🚫 Avoiding Scope Creep
To stay focused and avoid adding unnecessary features:
- Clearly defined scope.
- Stick to the motto: **"Make it work → Make it right → Make it fast"**

### 🧍 You are a team of one!
In this project, I take full ownership — as a project manager, developer, DevOps engineer, and reviewer.

## 🧰 1.2 Preparation

### 🧑‍💻 GitHub Setup
- ✅ Created a GitHub account.
- ✅ Forked the HiveBox repository to use as the base for the project.

### 🗂️ GitHub Project Board
- Created a **Kanban project board** linked to the repository.
- Columns used:
  - To Do
  - In Progress
  - In Review
  - Done

### 🔀 Branching Strategy
- Each phase is implemented on a **separate branch**.
- A **Pull Request (PR)** is created for each phase to merge it into the `main` branch.
- **No direct commits** to `main`.

### 📝 Documentation
- Every step is documented during implementation.
- All documentation is included in Markdown files or PR descriptions.

### 📡 Selected senseBox IDs
Three nearby environmental sensor boxes were selected from [openSenseMap.org](https://opensensemap.org):
- `5eba5fbad46fb8001b799786`
- `5c21ff8f919bf8001adf2488`
